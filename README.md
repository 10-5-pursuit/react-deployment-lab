# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


React Deployment Lab
Lab Setup

- [MY LIVE SITE URL](https://iridescent-brioche-c194b7.netlify.app)
Instructions
Choose one of your former labs for HTML or CSS (no JavaScript interactivity or DOM manipulation) - like Intro to CSS, CSS Grid, or Media Queries.

Move and convert your solution to the old lab into the new React app. If you want to make minor updates or improvements, go for it, but it is unnecessary. The critical part is to create your own react app that works and host it online.

Follow the appropriate deployment instructions from the guides repository
